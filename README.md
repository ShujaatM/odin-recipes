# odin-recipes

The current project is to develop a web-page that is an index with links to other web-pages with recipes. These recipes contain an image of the food, the ingredients and instructions.

This project required me to make us of relative links as the recipes web-pages and the images are within same domain. As well as this it also let me practice git (adding, committing and commenting) for the first proper time. I made some commits that, now looking back, are a bit redundant like when I made a commit for adding the title and the header for the web-page, these things could have just been inferred by the code.

I also made use of lists, both ordered and unordered, used headings and the <em> and <strong> tags to emphasis and embolden words.

Finally I used the anchor and image tags to provide the necessary links as well as some of their attributes besides just href and src; like rel and alt.
